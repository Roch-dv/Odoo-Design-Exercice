# Odoo-Design-Exercice

Hello, 

You will find here the exercise that you asked me. 

Concerning the mockup, I really like the different colors that make the page very light and attractive. These colors also help to separate the different sections and to have a good understanding of where we are. The curves, lines and edges help to create a good visual identity. They bring movement and dynamism to the user. 

What I didn't like so much was the awards part, so I improved it by adding a carousel to bring movement and draw the eye. 

I know there is still room for improvement but I would be happy to talk to you about it directly! 

Thanks a lot, 
Roch
